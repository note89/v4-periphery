            "description": "Concentrated liquidity is a key innovation in Uniswap v4 that significantly enhances capital efficiency. Unlike previous versions where liquidity was distributed uniformly across all price ranges, v4 allows liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate their assets within specific price ranges.\n\nFor example, if an ETH/USDC pair is trading around $2000, an LP might concentrate their liquidity between $1900 and $2100. This concentration means that their capital is fully utilized within this range, potentially earning more fees compared to having it spread across all possible prices.\n\nThis feature benefits both LPs and traders:\n- LPs can earn more fees with less capital by focusing on active price ranges.\n- Traders enjoy lower slippage due to deeper liquidity around current market prices.\n\nBy allowing precise liquidity allocation, Uniswap v4 achieves superior capital efficiency, making it more competitive and attractive in the DEX landscape.",
