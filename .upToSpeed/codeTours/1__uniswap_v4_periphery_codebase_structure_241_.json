Key features include:\n\n1. Swap Functionality: Handles various swap types (exact input/output, single/multi-hop).\n2. Liquidity Management: Provides methods for adding and removing liquidity.\n3. Pool Interaction: Communicates with the Uniswap v4 pool manager to execute trades and manage positions.\n4. Action Execution: Implements a flexible system for executing multiple actions in a single transaction.\n\nNote the extensive use of interfaces and libraries, promoting modularity and upgradability. The contract inherits from several base contracts, each responsible for specific functionalities.",
